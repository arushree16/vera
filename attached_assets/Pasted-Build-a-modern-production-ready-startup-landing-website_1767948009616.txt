Build a modern, production-ready startup landing website for a product called “Vera”.

Purpose:
The website is a public launch and marketing site for Vera, an AI-powered skincare compatibility platform that helps users prevent adverse skin reactions and make informed skincare decisions. This is not an app dashboard — it is a startup-style product website designed to attract users, build trust, and drive early sign-ups.

Tech Stack:
- Next.js (App Router)
- Tailwind CSS
- Framer Motion for subtle animations
- Clean, minimal, premium aesthetic (health + AI + trust)
- Fully responsive (mobile-first)
- SEO-friendly structure

Brand Tone:
- Calm
- Trustworthy
- Scientific but easy to understand
- Dermatology-inspired
- Ethical AI
- Avoid hype or exaggerated claims

Pages / Sections to Build:

1. Hero Section
- Headline:
  “Know Before You Apply.”
- Subheading:
  “Vera analyzes your skin, product ingredients, climate, and personal context to help prevent adverse skin reactions before they happen.”
- Primary CTA: “Join the Waitlist”
- Secondary CTA: “How Vera Works”
- Subtle abstract background visuals (skin, molecules, AI — no faces)

2. Problem Section – “Why Vera Exists”
Explain clearly:
- Skincare reactions are common and unpredictable
- Ingredients behave differently across skin types, climates, and medications
- Most people rely on trial-and-error
- Existing skincare apps focus on recommendations, not safety
Use short bullet points with icons.

3. Solution Section – “What Vera Does”
Explain the flow:
- Upload a photo of your skin
- Share concerns and optional skin history or medication information
- Enter a product name or upload a product image
- Vera evaluates compatibility before you apply
Display this as a clean step-by-step layout.

4. Key Features Section
Feature cards for:
- AI Skin Analysis (Computer Vision)
- Ingredient-Level Compatibility Checks
- Safety Verdict System: Safe / Caution / Risky
- Explainable Ingredient Reasoning
- Climate-Aware Skin Guidance
- Medication & Sensitivity Awareness
- Explicit Warnings on Ingredients to Avoid
- Safer Alternative Product Suggestions

5. Example Output Section
Create a static mock example:
- Product: Example Moisturizer
- Verdict: ⚠️ Caution
- Why:
  - Fragrance → irritation risk for sensitive skin
  - High humidity → increased congestion risk
- Recommendation:
  - Use sparingly or switch to a fragrance-free gel-based alternative
Present this like a clean results card.
